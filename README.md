### Simple Route - PHP ####

This is a light weight php routing system and you can start using this right away by simply creating a `index.php` file inside your main root directory.

```
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/routes/web.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/routes/api.php';

```

Thats all your program will eun smoothly. 

* We would like to mention that we are currenltly working on this routing system to immprove this in a cms like wordpress but with more coding support for simple websites with 1-5 pages which in case Laravel is a heavy framework.
